ROUGH IDEA — HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN CUSTOM CALL SCREEN
1. Load the VAPI widget secretly

You keep the VAPI widget on the page but hidden, so the visitor never sees it.
It only provides the engine for voice calling in the background.

2. Build your own UI (your own call screen)

You design a screen that looks like a phone dialer:

A big “Start Call” button

A profile picture

A waveform

Timer “00:00”

An “End Call” red button

Background color / logo

Whatever design you want

This UI is completely your own, not from VAPI.

3. When user presses your Start button → trigger VAPI call

Your button simply tells VAPI:
“start the call now.”

So your UI acts like the “front”, VAPI is the “engine”.

4. When user presses End Call → stop the VAPI call

Your red hangup button just tells VAPI to stop the call.

5. You control the timer yourself

When the call starts, you begin a timer in JavaScript.
When call ends, you stop it.

This creates the exact effect of a real mobile call screen.

6. OPTIONAL — Auto-call when page opens

You can make it start calling automatically if the user taps anywhere or clicks a “Start” consent button.
(Note: browsers don’t allow mic auto-start without user interaction.)

7. VAPI is fully hidden — only your screen is visible

VAPI handles:

voice

transcription

connection with your assistant

Your custom UI handles:

display

buttons

animations

timer

Think of it like this:

VAPI = the engine
Your HTML = the entire car
8. Workflow in simplest possible terms
Page loads → Your UI appears

(Your own custom-designed call interface)

⬇

User clicks “Start Call” → VAPI call begins
Your UI switches into “call active mode”

⬇

Timer starts
Waveform animates
User talks normally

⬇

User clicks “End Call” → VAPI stops
Timer stops
UI returns to start screen

9. You can style your UI to look exactly like a mobile call screen

green start button

red hangup button

black background

circular avatar

call timer

“Calling WebGlow…” text

Your imagination, your style — VAPI doesn’t restrict UI at all.
